# Uniform-Database-Management
The problem faced at the schools during uniform measurement is that everything is maintained on sheets and has to be entered manually for each student which will kill time.

The studentsâ€™ details will be unorganised and unprocessed which will be a major hurdle in the future. These cons can be completely eliminated with the use of UNIFORM DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. This database will manage the uniforms of each student in a school, seeing to it that proper sizes and colours are delivered to the students.
